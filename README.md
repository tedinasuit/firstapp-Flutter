# What is it?

My first ever flutter project. I am trying to understand how the Widget Tree structure works. How to do basic things like navigation, a counter, et cetera.

This test project has:
- Multiple pages (which are widgets)
- A working navigation bar
- A working Action Button with updating text
- A button that pops up a new page
